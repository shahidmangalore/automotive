            <p><strong>India-bound Porsche Taycan - Now in pictures</strong></p>
            <p>Porsche is all set to launch its first all-electric car, the Taycan, in India. This Taycan EV will be launched along with the facelifted Macan SUV on November 12, 2021, for the Indian market. Here's a picture gallery to take a closer look at the Taycan EV, which will rival the Mercedes-Benz EQC, Audi e-tron GT, and Jaguar I-Pace, when launched next month</p>
        <p>What still stands out are the DRLs with a quad-led setup inside each projector headlamp at the edges. It reminds you of all the modern Porsches available today</p>
        <p>Now on to the sides, the sophistication is continued with just a single solid line along the front and the back door. Even the charging port is on the fender just above the front wheel.</p>
            <p>In terms of design, the Taycan sports a very simple yet sophisticated styling. Its fascia portrays an aerodynamic look with its curved wheel arches and a dipping nose.</p>
